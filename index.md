# What do we do?
To realize our vision, AI Manthan undertakes a variety of activities:
1. **AI Manthan WhatsApp Community**: Our dynamic WhatsApp community serves as a vibrant hub for members to exchange ideas, resources, and event notifications, and pose questions related to AI. This platform fosters a collaborative environment where members can engage in meaningful discussions and share insights.
2. **AI Resources Compilation**: We meticulously curate and compile a comprehensive list of AI resources. This repository is readily accessible to our members, providing them with invaluable learning materials to enhance their knowledge and skills. We compile the following categories of resources:
  - Courses
  - Newsletters
  - Podcasts
  - Software Tools and Libraries
  - Datasets
  - Books
  - Research Papers and Journals
  - Ethics and Governance Resources
3. **Interactive Meetups**: Unlike conventional seminars, our meetups are designed to be highly interactive brainstorming sessions that encourage hands-on practice. By facilitating discussions and activities among technologists and business leaders alike, we ensure that our meetups are practical, engaging, and directly beneficial in addressing real-world problems.

AI Manthan is more than just a community; it is a movement towards ethically harnessing the power of AI to create a brighter, more equitable future. We invite all like-minded individuals and organizations to join us in this journey, contributing to and benefiting from our collective wisdom and initiatives.
